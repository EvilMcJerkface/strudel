   Environments to start/stop a system with TokuMX (MongoDB)
   data stores. Specify: tokumxServers,
   and workerHosts, each of which is a string of space-separated host
   names.
   This cluster consists of a set of "stand alone" TokuMX servers:
   mapping keys to servers is done explicitly by the client (instead
   of using sharding of MongoDB). This is to test multi-statement
   transactions of TokuMX, which is not available for a sharded
   environment.
